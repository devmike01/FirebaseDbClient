# FirebaseDbClient
Get your firebase private key from your Firebase console: Overview -> Project Settings -> Service Account ->Firebase Admin SDK.  
Once you click on the "Generate New Private Key" button, a new JSON file will be generated. 
Copy the file to your current working directory and replace constants.MY_CERTIFICATE_PATH with the json file path (e.g: C:\Users\Python\serviceKey.json)
The constants.BASE_URL is the reference of your database
